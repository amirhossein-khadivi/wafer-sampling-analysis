# wafer-sampling-analysis

In this project, various sampling processes are applied to a designed wafer containing multiple dies. Initially, the appropriate sample size is calculated using statistical methods based on proportion estimation. Then, different sampling techniques are employed to extract samples from the wafer, and the results are presented through visualizations. The goal of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of different sampling methods in assessing the quality or characteristics of the dies on the wafer.
